1. `Semantic segmentation`
   * Image segmentation with a U-Net-like architecture
   * Multiclass semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3+

2. `Classification`
   * 3D image classification from CT scan
   * Image classification with Vision Transformer (ViT)
   * Vision Transformer for Small-Size Datasets(Shift Patch Tokenization)
   * Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT)
   * Classification using Attention-based-DeepMIL
3. `OCR`
   * Captchas image reading OCR model
   * Handwriting OCR model
